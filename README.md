# populator-materials
Materials for the FAIR Data Point Populator paper in each step of the process. The repository contains input spreadsheets, intermediate RDF files, and links to the resulting entries in FAIR Data Point.

Flow of information:
**Spreadsheet -> RDF -> FAIR Data Point**

## Spreadsheets
The spreadsheets as used in the FAIR Data Point Populator are provided in each of the folders.

## RDF
Each directory also contains the RDF that results from a dry run. For demonstration purposes, FDP links are replaced with example.org links, and the RDF is concatenated into one file.

## FAIR Data Point links
The resulting entries in public FAIR Data Points are shown here.
